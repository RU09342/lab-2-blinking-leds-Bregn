Only the G2553 was required for the off board blink. The code was very similar to the others. 
SEL had to be set to 0 to be GPIO. DIR had to be set to 1 for an output for the LED and 0 for the button inputs. 
I had to look at the data sheet and try to mimic what the development board was doing on my breadboard to get desired funcitonality.
